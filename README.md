## Installation
***Make sure you don't have an older version of Chalk++ installed at the same time!***

Manually unzip in your GDWeave directory to install

Or import this zip as a local mod through R2MM etc.

## Usage

`Y` is the default hotkey and is changeable

### Modes
- Checkerboard (Half) dithering
- Dotted (1/9th) dithering
- Masking (freehand drawing)
- Fill

### Controls
0. Equip a chalk to activate Chalk++

1. Press `Y` cycle modes, hold down `<shift>` + `Y` to cycle backwards

2. You can hold down `<SHIFT>` **while using checkerboard pattern** to offset the cells targeted by  -- It's hard to explain but you'll see what I mean.

3. **you can mask while using dithering brushes, by holding `<CTRL>`**


4. In addition to alpha masking you can select a specific masking color by holding `<ALT>` and scrolling your mouse wheel-- any chalk that you draw outside of this color will be discarded

5.  While holding down `<ALT>`  click on a canvas cell to select the color of the cell as your masking color

6. To fill, equip the chalk/color you'd like to apply, select `fill` mode from the menu, and click on the color/area you wish to fill

## Changelog

### v1.0.2
- Hotfixed white chalk not working

### *v1.0.0*
- Now requires [Tacklebox](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/PuppyGirl/TackleBox/) as a dependency
to manage hotkeys (since BlueberryWolfi's APIs haven't been updated in nearly a year and are *dysfunctional*-
not actually saving any of the player's keybind changes.
Somebody should make a better Webfishing API ...ðŸ¤”)
- Minor changes/fixes
- Code overhaul

### v0.2.0 - UI Hotfix, Typeface change
- Hotfixed dangling UI dependency causing issues for some players
- Added cute font typeface for Chalk++ UI

### v0.0.12 - Performance and Quirk Fixes
- ***Now requires [Socks 0.4.0](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/toes/Socks/versions/) - be sure to update that!***

- Mostly unseen/internal code refactoring

### v0.0.11 - No-More-Stamps Mod Circumvention/Fix

- (NEW FEAT) Color filling ("Paint bucket fill")

### v0.0.5 - Masking UX Improvements and fixes
