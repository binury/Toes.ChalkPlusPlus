## üé® Usage

![](https://i.imgur.com/BE6nrlc.png 'UI Screenshot 2')

- Open Chalk++ Overlay: `Y` (changeable in settings).
- When active, benches and trees on canvases become invisible and intangible!

### Modes

- **Checkerboard (Half) dithering**
- **Dotted (1/9th) dithering**
- **Masking** (freehand)
- **Fill**
- **Symmetrical mirroring**

### Controls

1. Equip any chalk to start using Chalk++.
2. Press `Y` to cycle modes forward. Press `<Shift> + Y` to cycle _backwards_.
3. **Checkerboard brush offset:** Hold `<Shift>` while drawing.
4. **Masking:** Hold `<Ctrl>` while using dithering brushes.
   - You can now pick your masking color by clicking on the Chalk++ button in the UI!
   - OR, hold `<Alt>` while scrolling up or down to assign a masking color.
   - OR, `<Alt>` + click a canvas cell to set your mask to its color.
   - Chalk drawn outside your masking color is discarded.
5. **Fill tool:** Equip chalk/color ‚Üí select _Fill_ mode ‚Üí click an area to flood-fill.
6. **Quick erase:** Press `E` to erase without equipping the eraser.
   - Mode effects (mirror, brush patterns, etc.) still apply!

#### Line tool

The default behavior of line tool is to _chain lines_

```
A -> B -> C -> D
```

wherever you click it draws a line from the last click to there. Straightforward literally and figuratively.

**But** there are _two_ other controls for you to know:

**1. To end a chain and start a new line**

```
A->B->C  D->E
```

Hold down `<Ctrl>` to (stop chaining and) forcibly set the starting point a **new **line

**2. To draw a bunch of lines around a single point,**

```
B - A - D
    |
    C
```

- Hold down `<Shift>` when adding a line to retain the current segment as the origin point for your next line
