- Equip any chalk to start using Chalk++.
- Press `Y` to bring up the overlay UI and again to cycle modes forward.
  - Press `<Shift> + Y` to cycle _backwards_.
- Press on the Chalk++ button in the overlay to select a mode.
- Press on the palette button in the overlay to select a color mask.

### Masking

While masking, **chalk drawn outside your chosen masking color is discarded**.

- To use masking simply hold `<Ctrl>` while drawing with Chalk++ tools.
- Or, if you are going to be drawing for awhile, you can select and use the `freehand masking` mode.
- You can pick your masking color by clicking on the Chalk++ button in the UI...
  - OR, by holding `<Alt>` while scrolling up or down...
  - OR, `<Alt>` + clicking a canvas cell to set your mask to the cell's color.

### Modes

1. **Checkerboard (Half) dithering**
1. **Dotted (1/9th) dithering**
1. **Masking** (freehand)
1. **Bucket Fill**
1. **Line Tool**
1. **Symmetrical mirroring**

#### Checkerboard (¬Ω) dithering

![Checker brush example](https://i.imgur.com/wMdl3RO.png)

Brush pattern that is _half-filled_ with your chosen color

> [!TIP]
> Hold `<Shift>` while drawing to offset the grid pattern by 1x cell

#### Dotted (1/9th) dithering

![Dotting brush example](https://i.imgur.com/U4FiGfb.png)

Brush pattern of a square filled only with a single cell of your chosen color

### Bucket fill

### Line tool

![Line tool example](https://i.imgur.com/n5lLcCS.png)

Press and drag to show a line preview. Release to set your line.

> [!TIP]
> You can mask while using the line tool, too! (Holding `<Control>`)

### Symmetrical Mirroring

## Tips

### Quick erase

![Quick erase screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/jbTFdtp.png)

Press `E` (configurable in settings) to erase without equipping the eraser.
**Mode effects (mirror, brush patterns, etc.) will apply to the eraser pattern!**

### When active, benches and trees on canvases become invisible and intangible

_If_ you are _using Calico_, you will need to [change a setting](https://github.com/binury/Toes.ChalkPlusPlus/issues/7) for this to work!!! (For now)

> [!TIP]
> Hold `<Shift>` while drawing to offset the grid
